# Guess the Correlation Shiny App

An interactive Shiny application where users try to estimate the correlation between two variables by looking at a scatterplot. This app is designed to help students and learners develop intuition for correlation and scatterplots.

## Overview

This app allows users to:
- View a randomly generated scatterplot
- Guess the correlation coefficient (cor(X, Y)) both as multiple choice and by entering a number
- Receive instant feedback on the accuracy and sign of their guess
- Reveal the true correlation after submitting a guess
- Reload for a new random dataset and try again

## Future Enhancements
- Additional games or visualizations (placeholders included in the app)
